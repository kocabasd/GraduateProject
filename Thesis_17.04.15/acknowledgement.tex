Foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor Priv.-Doz. Dr. Nysret Musliu for the continuous support of my master thesis, for his patience, motivation, enthusiasm, and immense knowledge. His guidance and constructive critism helped me in all the time of research and writing of this thesis. I could not have imagined having a better advisor and mentor for my master thesis. \\

Besides my advisor, I would also like to thank the rest of the people of the Department for their help and support. \\

Last but not the least, I would like to thank my family, especially to my father Mehmet Kocabas and my mother Ummuhan Kocabas, for supporting me throughout my life.
